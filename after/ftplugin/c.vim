" uses `ctags` files for completion. This omnifunc is always set by the `c.vim`
" filetype plugin and simply does not provide matches if no `ctags` files exist.
" As I usually don't use `ctags` but have an autocompletion mechanism that
" decides which completion to run based on whether an omnifunc is set, I would
" rather have it not set.

" 0.9), there is an additional `c.lua` filetype plugin included with the
" software that also sets this, and if I want to override that, it seems I need
" an extra `c.lua` file doing that.
