-- Julia `LanguageServer.jl`
-- As of 2023-06, `nvim-lspconfig` uses a default server command that first
-- looks in `~/.julia/environments/nvim-lspconfig`, and if it doesn't exist or
-- `LanguageServer.jl` isn't installed there, it uses the default environment
-- instead.
-- It then searches in a couple ways of descending priority for a Julia
-- project to attach to.
-- I could implement automatic installation of the `LanguageServer.jl` package
-- here, but I feel like that's the kind of step I'd rather have control over,
-- even if it means some extra setup.
-- As is typical for Julia, it kind of takes a while to start up. I wonder if
-- something can be done about that.
-- I wonder whether this language server always just assumes that any Julia
-- code it gets to see has the same version as the Julia process running the
-- server or whether it actually respects a project's Julia version as
-- specified in `Manifest.toml`.
