" TODO: Add either a thesaurus file or a thesaurus function for the english
" language? (See `:h compl-thesaurus`)
"
" TODO: In several places here, I use mappings with the `<cmd>` argument, which
" aren't supported on older Vim versions.
" * Find out the exact versions where the functionality in question was added
" * See if I can find a way to abstract this, so that I don't need to write
"   version-sepcific branching in every instance of these mappings
" * Go over all those instances and improve them
" * Check out and utilize `<SID>`, which helps with keeping functions for
"   mappings script-local.
" * `<silent>` may come in handy too.

" NOTE: There are many claims that netrw is a bad and buggy piece of software
" and should probably be rewritten entirely. However, it does more than just
" being a file browser, which is why it's not a good idea to fully disable it.
" However, replacing the file browsing part with another plugin makes sense.
" The situation with netrw is unfortunate. On the one hand, it would be more
" unix-y to separate the text editor and the file browser into two loosely
" coupled standalone programs. On the other hand, given that this thing already
" exists, it would be nice to make use of it as a vanilla part of Vim. Still, I
" think the best solution for now is to just ignore it and hope that it gets
" deprecated in favor of a better solution or something.
"
" NOTE: I have now found out that sourcing a VimScript file with a bunch of code
" that sits in non-executed branches can still be way slower than not sourcing
" those parts at all. I have also found a robust way to determine the location
" of this `init.vim` file. Taken together, I am now able and choosing to put the
" feature sections into individual files.
"
" NOTE: User-defined Vimscript functions are usually named in CamelCase to avoid
" confusion with built-in functions.

" NOTE: There is an issue with syntax highlighting that I may encounter for a
" while when editing this file. Specifically, lua code blocks may show closing
" parentheses as erroneous when in fact they aren't and this may also break the

" {{{2 Notes about features/plugins

" Regarding `tpope/vim-commentary` vs. `preservim/nerdcommenter`:
" `vim-commentary` is a nice plugin insofar as it's very small and leverages a
" bunch of vanilla Vim functionality, including operators/motions. Seems to me
" like it does exactly what needs to be done, exactly how it needs to be done,
" without a lot of bells and whistles. `nerdcommenter` has more configurable
" behavior, e.g. how to handle empty lines, whether to comment small pieces
" instead of whole lines out if possible, etc. Seems like both plugins are very
" stable and here to stay, as of 2023-06.
"
" `lervag/vimtex`: Should not be lazily loaded because the plugin basically
" handles that by itself already through filetype/autoload.
" There is a language server for TeX called TexLab, but it seems to me like
" `vimtex` is very mature, Vim-tailored, and full-fledged, providing a bunch of
" stuff that the language server does not or can not, while the latter does not
" add a whole lot more.
"
" `JuliaEditorSupport/julia-vim`: This plugin, as of 2023-06, does two things:
" LaTeX-to-unicode substitutions and block-wise movements with `matchit`. It is
" not a syntax or indentation plugin, as these are already included with Vim.
" It seems to me that the block-wise movements work without the plugin too, not
" sure why, but if I explicitly disable them for the plugin they don't work
" anymore. Since this plugin adds like 30ms startup time, I lazy load it if
" possible. For some reason it doesn't work with `lazy.nvim`s `ft` option, but
" with `event = "FileType julia"` it's fine. Maybe I should see if there's some
" other LaTeX-to-unicode plugin that's better than this one and always
" available, as that's really the only functionality I seem to need from this.
"
" `matcatc/vim-asciidoc-folding`: As of 2023-06, it seems that Neovim (though
" not Vim) comes with an AsciiDoc syntax file, but there's no support for folds.
" This plugin provides an `ftplugin`-based script with a fold expression. Seems
" like LSP support for AsciiDoc is something that's been planned but not made a
" reality yet. Treesitter support is also something that can be found as a
" non-checked todo in GitHub issues.
"
" `nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter`: As of 2023-07, the readme file says it
" requires the "latest" Neovim version, with "nightly recommended". This is
" probably because the plugin is still heavily developed and probably even
" influences the development of Neovim itself. However, e.g.
" `nvim-orgmode/orgmode` requires Neovim 0.8.0 and `nvim-treesitter`, and so I
" think I'll enable `nvim-treesitter` for older versions too and see how it
" goes.
"
" `neovim/nvim-lspconfig`: I think, at least for now, that it makes sense to tie
" the list of configured LSP servers together with the plugin and not to create
" separation of the LSP server list and LSP plugins. So right now, the feature
" `nvim_lspconfig` basically means "the plugin together with its list of
" configured LSP servers".
" The lazy loading events were inspired from here: https://github.com/LazyVim/
" LazyVim/blob/86ac9989ea15b7a69bb2bdf719a9a809db5ce526/lua/lazyvim/plugins/lsp/
" init.lua#L5 Does lazy loading it this way really improve anything, though?
"
" `L3MON4D3/LuaSnip`: There is this optional post-install/-update step `make
" install_jsregexp` which I have omitted for now, but may want to look into at
" some point.
